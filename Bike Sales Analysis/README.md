Bike Sales Project: In this project I used my skills to clean the data and make some visualization that were able to generate some insights about the dataset.

Used tool in this project: Excel

Skills used in this project: Data cleaning, Dinamic Visualizations, Statistics

Spreadsheets skill used in this project: Pivot tables, Formulas

Steps: 
1- Clean the data: First, I made another sheet to get the columns that I needed for this project, after that I made sure that all the data has the proper format and change some values to be more clear (e.g, Change "S" values in the "Marital Status" column to "Single").


3- Create useful column: I created a column named "Age Brackets" to group customers by age.


2- Pivot tables: I made another sheet with some pivot tables that were able to provide some insights and generate visulizations (e.g, Average income of customers by gender).


3- Dashboard: I made a dinamic dashboard containing all the visualizations from the pivot tables and add some pivot slicers to get filters for the dashboard.
