Bike Sales Project: In this project I used my skills to clean the data and make some visualization that were able to generate some insights about the dataset.

Used tool in this project: Excel

Skills used in this project: Data cleaning, Dinamic Visualizations, Statistics, Data Analysis

Spreadsheets skill used in this project: Pivot tables, Formulas

Steps: 1- Clean the data: First, I made another sheet to get the columns that I needed for this project, after that I made sure that all the data has the proper format and change some values to be more clear (e.g, Change "0" values in the "Holiday Flag" column to "Not Holiday").

3- Create useful column: I created many columns to group some data by brackets (e.g, Temperature, to see if the hottest or coldest weeks affects sales).

2- Pivot tables: I made another sheet with some pivot tables that were able to provide some insights and generate visulizations (e.g, Average Weekly by Store).

3- Dashboard: I made a dinamic dashboard containing all the visualizations from the pivot tables and add some pivot slicers to get filters for the dashboard.
