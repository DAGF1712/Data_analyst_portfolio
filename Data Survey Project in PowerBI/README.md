In this project, I used Power BI to transform and analyze data from a survey about data professionals. I applied various data cleaning and manipulation techniques, such as removing duplicates, splitting columns. I also created a dashboard to visualize the results of the survey and answer some key questions, such as:

What is the average salary by job titles and roles of data professionals?

What are the most common job titles and roles of data professionals?

What are the most popular languages used by data professionals?

How satisfied are data professionals with their jobs and salaries?

How difficult was to break into data?


The dashboard consists of several interactive charts and filters that allow the user to explore the data and gain insights. The project demonstrates my skills in using Power BI to transform and present data in an effective and engaging way.
