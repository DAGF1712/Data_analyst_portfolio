Fifa 20 dataset project:
In this project I used my skills to clean the data and make some visualization that can generate some insights about the dataset.

Used tool in this project: Google sheets

Skills used in this project:
1- Data cleaning
2- Visualizations
3- Statistics

Spreadsheets skill used in this project:
1- Pivot tables
2- Data validation
3- Named ranges
4- Conditional formating
5- Formulas

Steps: 
1- Clean the data: First, I made another sheet to get the columns that I needed for this project, after that I made sure that all the data has the proper format.


2- Get basic stats: I made another sheet to get the basics stats (average, min, max, count) to know a little bit more about the data.

3- Top 10 nationalities by average overall: I made a pivot table to get a visualization to get the top 10 nationalities by the average overall of the players. In this step I find something weird, as a football fan I realized that the 10 nationalities were not what I was expecting, I noticed that many countries where getting in the visualization because they just got a couple of players in the dataset which lead to wrong interpretations.

4- Top 10 nationalities by average overall fixed: I made other sheet to change the results of the previous one, in this case I made a pivot table to show only the top 10 countries by the average overall of the players that had more than the average number of players by country. This gave me the results that I was expecting (kinda, some suprises got there)

5- Top players by nationality: I made a dinamic visualization using data validation to showcase the best players by the selected country in the dropdown. Using conditional formating I gave colors to the cells based in the overall of the player.

6- Right foot players vs left foot players: I made a table and a visualization to see the stats (count, average weight, average height, average value, average wage, average age, average overall) betweeen right foot and left foot players.
